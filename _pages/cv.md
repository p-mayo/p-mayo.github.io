# Education
## PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, UK (2017 - 2021)
- Advisors: Prof. Alin M. Achim \& Robin Holmes
- Viva date: 7th of October, 2021
- Research Topic: **MRI Classification for Alzheimer's Disease detection via Sparse Representations**
- As part of the Visual Information Laboratory (VILab), this PhD research project focused on the development of a machine learning-based algorithm for medical images, particularly MRI, for the classification of patients with Alzheimer's Disease or its prodromal stage: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
- Use of **Convolutional Sparse Coding** and **Neural Networks** implemented on Python (mainly using the **Pytoch** library)

## MSc. in Biomedical Engineering, University of Bristol, UK (2015 - 2016)
- Advisors: Prof. Alin M. Achim \& Robin Holmes
- Thesis: **Structural MRI Analysis in Pre-surgical Paediatric Epilepsy**. The thesis focused on the Analysis of structural MRI scans to detect epileptogenic zones in paediatric patients by using SPM'12 and CAT'12 (Matlab Anatomical Toolboxes), as well a High Performance Computing provided by the UoB.
- Relevant taught units: 
	- Biomedical Imaging
	- Computational Neuroscience
	- Digital Filters and Spectral Analysis
	- Engineering Research Skills.
		
## Bachelor Degree in Computer Systems Engineering, Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes, Mexico (2008 - 2013)
- The program offered by the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Aguascalientes covered a wide variety of units, including physics, mathematics, electronics, control theory, and databases among others. There was a strong emphasis on programming units with a variety of projects to showcase the developed skills, such as a compiler and mobile games.
- Top of class with Honours.

# Professional Experience
## Senior Research Associate, University of Bristol, UK (2023-)
- Project: Deep Compressive Quantitative MRI.
- Principal Investigator: Mohammad Golbabaee.
- Funding Institution: EPSRC.
- Research, design and development of a new model capable to solve the quantitative MRI problem, whose traditional approach is time consuming
and unfeasible for certain studies. This project involves knowledge from various domains such as magnetic resonance, fingerprinting, neural networks and optimisation techniques.
		
## Research and Development Engineer, Micrima, UK (2021 - 2023)
- Working within a team to develop a new device for microwave-based Breast cancer detection device.
- Algorithm development, device monitoring and diagnostics.
- Data collection assisting the R \& D team in the development of the device.
- Planning and designing clinical and volunteer trials and subsequent data analysis.
- Various tasks, from digital signal processing to investigation of materials to mimic breast tissue.


## Research Associate, University of Bristol, UK (2021 - 2022)
- Development of an algorithm for detecting various parasitic eggs in microscopy images. 
- Main tools and frameworks: Python, Pytorch, Faster-RCNN, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
such as Pix2Pix and CycleGAN for image enhancement.


## Software Developer, Softtek, Mexico (2013 - 2015)
- Analysis, design and development of applications and systems, either built from scratch or enhancements of legacy software. Most of the works were built using Microsoft technologies, such as ASP and Microsoft SQL Server, aiming to meet the requirements and specifications provided by the customers.
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA). Troubleshooting skills which involve deep analysis of applications built in C\#, ASP, Microsoft SQL DTS packages among others, and providing solutions to uncovered issues.
- Development of automated tasks using AppWorx and batch/shell scripting.
