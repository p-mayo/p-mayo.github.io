The main drive in the work I seek out, is the use of artificial intelligence in the healthcare sector, to aid in its progress 
and improvements, and as such, I'm happy to announce that, as of March 2023, I returned to the University of Bristol (UOB) and 
started a position as a Senior Research Associate. There is a convergence of different knowledge domains required to carry out this project, 
which is proven to be both a challenge and an excellent opportunity for learning and contributing to the research community.

In addition to programming, I am passionate about baking, and I'm always trying new recipes with adjustments here and there that I often 
share with friends and family. It's a tasy way of relieve some stress! With less frequency, I also enjoy other activities like
crocheting, knitting, drawing and running. Thus,this website focuses on professional achievements as well as some 
non-professional stuff.
