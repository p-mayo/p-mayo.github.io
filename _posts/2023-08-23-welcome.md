Hello! I have decided to write some posts every now and then with anything that could be worth mentioning.
This is not a place exclusively about career content, I will post from time to time about other topics,
thoughts and so on! So, in addition to neural networks, MRI and programming, you can expect content about:

- Baking, the latest experiment or the newest experiment I've tried, perhaps also the fails
- Drawing/painting (watercolour), I enjoy these activities every now and then. I have "seasons" in which I might 
paint and draw for weeks during my free time. They are also relaxing activities that allow me to de-stress and 
clear my mind.

I think in general sharing stuff that might encourage others to develop and improve skill-wise, even though I don't
consider myself an expert, I hope my experience and thoughts might come useful to whoever reads, perhaps because
they find an answer, some advice or maybe just a break.
