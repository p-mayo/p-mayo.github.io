It's been a while since the last time I touched this site, but at least I've come to update some good news! I've added some of the latest publications, [DIP-MRF at ISBI](/publication/2024-05-27_dip_mrf), [StodIP at the MICCAI workshop MLMI](/publication/2024-10-23_stodip), [MRF-IDDPM at ISMRM](/publication/2025-05-13_ddm_qmri_ismrm), and the latest, [MRF-DiPh has been accepted at MICCAI!](/publication/2024-06-17_mrf_diph).

All are good news, and have involved a lot of hard work, late nights, and litres of coffee! 

I hope to be a bit more active and provide some updates here and there, it also helps to keep my brain sharp and as a good reminder of the work done. I also need to tidy up the site a bit.
