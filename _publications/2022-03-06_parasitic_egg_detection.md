## Abstract
Automatic detection of parasitic eggs in microscopy images has the potential to increase the 
efficiency of human experts whilst also providing an objective assessment. The time saved by 
such a process would both help ensure a prompt treatment to patients, and off-load excessive 
work from experts' shoulders. Advances in deep learning inspired us to exploit successful 
architectures for detection, adapting them to tackle a different domain. We propose a framework 
that exploits two such state-of-the-art models. Specifically, we demonstrate results produced 
by both a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Faster-RCNN, for image enhancement and 
object detection respectively, on microscopy images of varying quality. The use of these 
techniques yields encouraging results, though further improvements are still needed for certain 
egg types whose detection still proves challenging. As a result, a new dataset has been created 
and made publicly available, providing an even wider range of classes and variability.
