## Abstract
We introduce MRF-DiPh, a novel physics informed denoising diffusion approach for 
multiparametric tissue mapping from highly accelerated, transient-state quantitative 
MRI acquisitions like Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). Our method is derived 
from a proximal splitting formulation, incorporating a pretrained denoising diffusion 
model as an effective image prior to regularize the MRF inverse problem. Further, during 
reconstruction it simultaneously enforces two key physical constraints: (1) k-space 
measurement consistency and (2) adherence to the Bloch response model. Numerical experiments 
on in-vivo brain scans data show that MRF-DiPh outperforms deep learning and compressed 
sensing MRF baselines, providing more accurate parameter maps while better preserving 
measurement fidelity and physical model consistencyâ€”critical for solving reliably inverse 
problems in medical imaging.
